## About
- It simply loads **Total Covid-19 Watch cases in All over world** from [API](https://api.covid19api.com/).
- It notifies total cases of Covid-19 Watch in world after every 15 minute.


*It uses `PeriodicWorkManager` which is scheduled at the first run of an app. After that, `Worker` will execute after every 15 minute of interval and will show notification on Android's system tray.*
